## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tkavindi/Sentiment-Analysis-Project.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-Project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. If you don't have `requirements.txt`, you can manually install the following libraries:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - scikit-learn
   - nltk
   - matplotlib (for visualization)
   - seaborn

   Example:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can use the sentiment analysis model in the following way:

1. Load your dataset (can be in CSV, JSON, or any format supported by pandas).
2. Preprocess the data as per your needs (such as removing stop words, stemming, tokenizing, etc.).
3. Train the machine learning model using your dataset.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.
5. Make predictions on new text data.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sentiment_model import train_model, predict_sentiment

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Train model
model = train_model(data)

# Make predictions
text = "I love this product!"
sentiment = predict_sentiment(model, text)

print(sentiment)  # Output: Positive
```
